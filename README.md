Challenge is to make a webpage using the reference files with **SASS** that changes it's text color to red/blue when clicking on the button. Following **SASS** features were used in this exercise:

* Variables
* Mixins
* Nesting
* Partials & Import
* Extend/Inheritance
* Maths Operators

By the end of this challenge I learned about preprocessor, generated **CSS** from **CSS** preprocessor **(i.e SASS/SCSS)**, combined multiple **SASS** files into a single final **CSS** file and minified the **CSS** output.
